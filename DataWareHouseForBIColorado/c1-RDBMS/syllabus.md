Syllabus

WEEK 1
Course Introduction

Module 1 provides the context for Database Management Essentials. When you’re done, you’ll understand the objectives for the course and know what topics and assignments to expect. Keeping these course objectives in mind will help you succeed throughout the course! You should read about the database software requirements in the second lesson of module 1. I recommend that you try to install the DBMS software this week before assignments begin in module 3.

WEEK 2
Relational Data Model and the CREATE TABLE Statement

Now that you have the context for database features and environments, you’ll start building! In this module, you’ll learn relational data model terminology, integrity rules, and the CREATE TABLE statement. You’ll apply what you’ve learned in practice and graded problems using a database management system (DBMS), either the Oracle Cloud database server with the SQL Developer client or the PostgreSQL database server with the pgAdmin client. You will use the SQL CREATE TABLE statement and populate your tables using given SQL INSERT statements. The concept quiz provides an assessment of your understanding of the video lessons and associated notes. You should complete the concept quiz before starting practice problems and the graded assignment to ensure your conceptual understanding of the material.

WEEK 8
Advanced Query Formulation with SQL

Module 12 provides optional advanced material on query formulation for learners who seek expert level knowledge and skills. Advanced query formulation can provide an edge in the workplace helping learners reach expert status with more value to an organization. Due to the advanced material, Module 12 provides Lesson 6 as honors with problems, quiz, assignment, and self evaluation. Module 12 covers four somewhat independent topics (outer joins, nested queries, membership exceptions, and containment exceptions) so learners can study these topics separately. These specialized problem areas, more difficult than combining tables with joins, provide important value to organizations when occurring in practice. To aid learners, Module 12 provides unique pedagogy with two problem-solving aids, text patterns to recognize elements of in problem statements and statement patterns to write template SELECT statements as an initial step to a complete SELECT statement. Lesson 5 provides a convenient summary of the text and statement patterns to provide learners a platform for the practice problems and assignment. The concept quiz provides an assessment of your understanding of the video lessons and associated notes. You should complete the concept quiz before starting practice problems and the graded assignment to ensure your conceptual understanding of the material.

How It Works
General

How do I pass the course?


  To earn your Course Certificate, you’ll need to earn a passing
    grade on each of the required assignments—these can be quizzes,
    peer-graded assignments, or programming assignments. Videos, readings,
    and practice exercises are there to help you prepare for the graded
    assignments. 
What do start dates and end dates mean?


  Once you enroll,
    you’ll have access to all videos, readings, quizzes, and programming
    assignments (if applicable). If you choose to
    explore the course without purchasing, you may not be able to access
    certain assignments.  If you don’t finish all graded assignments before
    the end of the course, you can reset your deadlines. Your
    progress will be saved and you’ll be able to pick up where you left off.
What are due dates? Is there a penalty for submitting my
      work after a due date?


  Within a course, there are suggested due dates to help you
    manage your schedule and keep coursework from piling up. Quizzes and
    programming assignments can be submitted late without consequence.
    However, it is possible that you won't receive a grade if you submit
    your peer-graded assignment too late because classmates usually review
    assignment within three days of the assignment deadline.
Can I re-attempt an assignment?


      Yes. If you want to improve your grade, you can always try again.
        If you’re re-attempting a peer-graded assignment, re-submit your work
        as soon as you can to make sure there’s enough time for your classmates
        to review your work. In some cases you may need to wait before
        re-submitting a programming assignment or quiz. We encourage you to
        review course material during this delay.
